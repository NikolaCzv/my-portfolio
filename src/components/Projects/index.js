                One of the steps in my career change was FlatIron School (Oct 2019 - Jan 2020).
                During the 4 months bootcamp I have have learned basics of the
                full stack development.
                TravelSmart was my finall school project. Full stack done by me,
                using React and Ruby on Rails.

                is a social media web app, that has a goal to help
                people who like to travel often. The idea is to help people save while
                they are on the trip. They can show the dates that they will be away and
                try to rent their place in that period of time to their folowers.
                Also, while they are away,they can share experiance while posting pictures,
                see posts from their folowers.
